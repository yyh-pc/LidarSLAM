  # Undistortion mode, to correct rolling shutter distortion during frame acquisition:
  #  0) No undistortion is performed :
  #     - End scan pose is optimized using rigid registration of raw scan and map.
  #     - Raw input scan is added to maps.
  #  1) Minimal undistortion is performed (might be unstable if jumps occur):
  #     - Begin scan pose is linearly interpolated between previous and current end scan poses.
  #     - End scan pose is optimized using rigid registration of undistorted scan and map.
  #     - Scan is linearly undistorted between begin and end scan poses.
  #  2) Ceres-optimized undistortion is performed (slower, and may be unstable):
  #     - Both begin and end scan poses are optimized using registration of undistorted scan and map.
  #     - Scan is linearly undistorted between begin and end scan poses.
