  # How to estimate Ego-Motion (approximate relative motion since last frame).
  # The ego-motion step aims to give a fast and approximate initialization of new
  # frame world pose to ensure faster and more precise convergence in Localization step.
  #  0) No ego-motion step is performed : relative motion is Identity, new estimated
  #     Tworld is equal to previous Tworld. Fast, but may lead to unstable and imprecise
  #     Localization step if motion is important.
  #  1) Previous motion is linearly extrapolated to estimate new Tworld pose from the
  #     2 previous poses. Fast and precise if motion is roughly constant and continuous
  #  2) Estimate Trelative (and therefore Tworld) by globally registering new frame
  #     on previous frame. Slower and need textured enough environment, but do not
  #     rely on constant motion hypothesis.
  #  3) Previous motion is linearly extrapolated to estimate new Tworld pose from
  #     the 2 previous poses. Then this estimation is refined by globally registering
  #     new frame on previous frame. Slower and need textured enough environment,
  #     but should be more precise and rely less on constant motion hypothesis.
  ego_motion: 1

  # Undistortion mode, to correct rolling shutter distortion during frame acquisition.
  # The undistortion should greatly improve the accuracy for smooth motions,
  # but might be unstable for high-frequency motions.
  #  0) NONE: no undistortion is performed :
  #     - End scan pose is optimized using rigid registration of raw scan and map.
  #     - Raw input scan is added to map.
  #  1) ONCE: undistortion is performed only one using estimated ego-motion:
  #     - Begin and end scan poses are linearly interpolated using estimated ego-motion.
  #     - Scan is linearly undistorted between begin and end scan poses.
  #     - Scan pose is iteratively optimized using rigid registration of undistorted scan and map.
  #     - Undistorted scan is added to map.
  #  2) REFINED: undistortion is iteratively refined using optimized ego-motion:
  #     - Begin and end scan poses are linearly interpolated using ego-motion.
  #     - Scan is linearly undistorted between begin and end scan poses.
  #     - Scan pose is optimized using rigid registration of undistorted scan and map.
  #     - Iterate the three previous steps with updated ego-motion and poses.
  #     - Undistorted scan is added to map.
